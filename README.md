# ElecLedger
ElecLedger is a blockchain based electronic voting system. This project represents an effort to leverage benefits of blockchain such as cryptographic foundations and transparency to achieve an effective scheme for e-voting. The proposed scheme conforms to the fundamental requirements for e-voting schemes and achieves end-to-end verifiability. The project utilizes a blockchain system based on Kubernetes cluster connected via IBM blockchain platform.
